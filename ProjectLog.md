#### Starting Point

Gathering data for the project.  
Movie and TV show data from IMDB and TMDB. Missing movie poster data from TMBD, will be added later.  
Next steps will be to check the data, clean if necessary, look at token/character limit to ensure it fits within the embedding model's constraints, and start developing the vector DB.
